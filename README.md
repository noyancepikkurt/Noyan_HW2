# Noyan_HW2
I have developed a news application that allows users to check the weather, the exchange rates for dollar and euro to Turkish lira and read news articles. If the user grants location permission, they can receive weather updates. The app allows users to filter news articles by category or search by headline. Users can also add articles to their favorites and remove them at any time. If the user tries to access the app without an internet connection, an alert message will appear saying, "You are currently in offline mode. You can only read your favorite articles." The user will then be directed to their favorites section, where they can read the articles they have previously added while offline.

# Features
- Users can select categories and filter news articles based on their preferences.
- Users can search for news articles using keywords in the article titles.
- Users can add news articles to their favorites list and remove them later.
- When the user is offline, they can still read their favorite news articles.

# Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:
1. Open the application on your mobile device.
2. If you want to know the weather in your location, please permission for location access.
3. You can read news now.
4. You can change the news category you want to read or search for news by their title.
5. To add an new to your favorites list, click on the "Add to favorites" button.
6. You can read the news you have added to your favorites even when you don't have an internet connection.
